## Description
This app was created with the intent of the end user being able to create a svg logo from the question they are prompted. 

- [Video link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PPipVNRvv5-kUqWUoePuTAUdoZ2Szr28/view) of walkthrough of the application.
## Installation
Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/OxMagnus/SVG-Logo-Maker

Open in VS Code. If you do not have VS code you must install it.

Using the terminal, install node.js v16. If you have homebrew, the command should look like the following (brew install node@16), however this may vary and the documentation should be consulted.

Once node.js v16 is installed, in the terminal, utilize the command npm init -y to initialize and create a package.json where project files will be stored.

Next, use the terminal to run the command npm i to install the dependencies associated with this application (developers may need to install inquirer and jest directly from the command line, to do so the command for inquirer will be npm i inquirer@8.2.4 to install v8.2.4 of the inquirer, and npm i jest to install the latest version of jest).

To run the application, within the terminal, type the command node index.js.
